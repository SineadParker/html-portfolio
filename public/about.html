<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p><h2>Hello, World!</h2>
  <br/> My name is Sinead and I have tried a few different things before I began to learn the web development skills that I'm currently learning.
  <br/> Including completing a Bachelor's of Applied Psychology, customer service, Au Pairing, and, most recently, working in student accommodation on a college campus. 
  <br/> While I enjoyed each of those chapters, I am now an aspiring Web Developer gaining new knowledge and learning new skills every day. </p>

  <p> This website is my portfolio to demonstrate my skills as I learn them. My goal is to eventually have a career that challenges me intelectually and satisfies my need for flexibilty in my work.
  <br/> It seems that the web development industry provides opportunity to meet and work with interesting people, and continuously be learning new skills because the industry is always evolving. I am excited for this future and for the projects this will allow me to work on.
  <br/> I will be updating this site as I continue to grow in my skills and professionalism so watch this space...</p>
