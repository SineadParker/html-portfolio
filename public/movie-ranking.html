<h3>Everything, Everywhere, All At Once</h3>

<p>At first glance this is a film about a Chinese American woman who runs a laundromat with her husband and struggles to do her taxes and get along with her daughter. 
    <br/> It turns out to be fantastically weird and wonderful film about hope, connection, generational struggles within a family and the meaning of life as you choose it to be. 
    <br/>I was deeply inspired by this film and connected to the characters and the chaos.</p>
<h3>Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse</h3>

<p>This film seems like it's just going to be another Spiderman movie and we've had our fair share of that so I wasn't expecting too much when I went to see it. 
    <br/>However, the creators of this Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse pushed the boundaries of animation. It was so creative, fun, and artistic.
    <br/> I was very inspired by the artistry of the film and moved by the characters and stories and how they weaved into one another.</p>
<h3>The Greatest Showman</h3>

<p>This film follows the story of people who are ostracized because they're considered "freaks" and P.T. Barnum who, 
    <br/>together with his family, creates the circus as a safe place for these people to be seen. 
    <br/>The whirlwind of the story and the beautiful original soundtrack and choreography are awe-inspiring.
